The dashboard was designed to display monthly and quarterly sales, geographic distribution of sales, market share analysis, and a ranking of best-selling products. These tasks were vital for uncovering insights that could drive strategic initiatives.

**Action:** To achieve our goals, we undertook the following steps:
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted a detailed analysis of the e-commerce sales data, calculating key metrics such as total sales, average sales, and the total and average number of monthly transactions.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Developed an interactive dashboard that visually represents monthly and quarterly sales trends, the geographic distribution of sales, market share, and rankings of best-selling products. This dashboard served as a powerful tool for visualizing complex data and making it accessible for strategic planning.
- **Strategic Insights:** Utilized the findings from our analysis to identify high-performing products and regions. These insights informed our recommendations for strategic adjustments to sales and marketing approaches.

**Result:** The insights gained from our comprehensive e-commerce sales analysis led to significant improvements in the company's performance. By focusing on high-performing regions and products, we were able to increase target product sales by 20% and reduce marketing expenses by 15%.

Situation: I was tasked with developing a dashboard that provides a comprehensive analysis of the Brazilian labor market between 2020 and 2024. The primary objective was to offer a clear and detailed view of admissions, dismissals, and salary variations by region, state, and economic sector, as well as allow comparisons over time.

Task: My responsibility was to build an interactive dashboard using Power BI to organize and visualize the data in an intuitive way. This included creating charts that allow users to explore different data dimensions, such as salary evolution, labor movement balance, and regional and sectoral comparisons.

Action: By collecting data from reliable sources, such as Novo Caged – MTE, I structured the dashboard with the following key features:

Admissions and Dismissals: I developed charts that show the total number of admissions and dismissals by region, state, and municipality, highlighting the areas with the highest worker turnover.

Salary Evolution: I created a line chart to visualize the evolution of average salaries for admissions and dismissals over time.

Sectoral Economic Analysis: I organized a bar chart detailing the distribution of admissions and dismissals across economic sectors like services, commerce, industry, and agriculture.

Interactivity: I added filters to allow users to select different months and years, providing customizable temporal analysis and making it easier to view the net balance of labor movements by sector and region.

Result: As a result, the dashboard I developed is a powerful and visually attractive tool that can help managers and analysts understand trends in the Brazilian labor market. It provides valuable insights by allowing users to quickly identify patterns in admissions, dismissals, and salary movements, all in an interactive and accessible way.
